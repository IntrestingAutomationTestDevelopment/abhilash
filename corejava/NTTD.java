	/**
	 * Security No encryption; data is transmitted in plain text. 
	 * Secure communication using encryption (via SSL/TLS). 
	 * Encryption Not encrypted,  making data vulnerable to interception and attacks. Encrypted using SSL/TLS,
	 * ensuring data confidentiality. Certificate No SSL/TLS certificate is
	 * required. Requires an SSL/TLS certificate to establish trust. Port Operates
	 * on port 80. Operates on port 443. Speed Slightly faster due to no encryption
	 * overhead. Slightly slower due to encryption/decryption overhead. Data
	 * Integrity Data can be altered during transmission. Ensures data integrity;
	 * unauthorized modifications are detectable. Authentication No verification of
	 * the serverâ€™s identity. Verifies the identity of the server using
	 * certificates. SEO Impact Not favored by search engines. Preferred by search
	 * engines, boosting rankings. Use Cases Suitable for non-sensitive data (e.g.,
	 * blogs). Ideal for sensitive data (e.g., banking, e-commerce). Visual
	 * Indicator Browsers show "Not Secure" for HTTP sites. Displays a padlock icon
	 * and "Secure" in browsers. Why HTTPS is Better
